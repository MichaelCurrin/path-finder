Or, you might want to know whether a certain social media is in use or not. Perhaps you have a list of usernames around your name or your company's name and you wish to see which ones are available, taken on Twitter, Instagram, etc. Perhaps you want a specific Instragram handle which is your firstname and lastname and you want to be first to know if it ever becomes available, so that you can take it.
